EVAN:
I think we just call the api once a week and store the data in
the database then run the algorithim on it to add the edges in the
network.

When a user searches for a ticker, we just query the database
and display the graph aka the weights of the different edges but
idk if each time we have to recalculate the weights.

I think each time a user inputs a ticker we check if the weights
are calculated => if not we calculate the weight for that ticker and
store it in the database in a new column and if it does we just
display it. This improves performance and not taking a ton of time
to run.
